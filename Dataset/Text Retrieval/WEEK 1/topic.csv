Natural Language Processing (NLP),"This topic covers the technique for processing natural language to obtain understanding, involving lexical analysis, semantic analysis, and parsing. It also discusses the challenges of NLP, such as ambiguity and the need for common sense and reasoning."
State of the Art of NLP,"This topic discusses the current capabilities and limitations of NLP, including the accuracy of part-of-speech tagging and parsing, the ability to perform semantic analysis and inference, and the difficulties in performing deep semantic analysis and speech act analysis."
Relation between NLP and Text Retrieval,"This topic explores how NLP techniques are used in text retrieval, the use of shallow NLP techniques in search engines, and the need for deeper NLP techniques for complex search tasks and question answering."
Text Access,"This topic discusses strategies to help users access text data, focusing on how a text information system can help users access the relevant text data."
Push vs Pull Strategies,"This topic discusses two different ways to connect users with information: the pull mode, where users initiate the information access process, and the push mode, where the system pushes or recommends information to the user."
Querying vs Browsing,"This topic discusses two ways to help users in the pull mode: querying, where a user enters a query and the system returns relevant documents, and browsing, where users navigate to relevant information by following the paths supported by the structures of documents."
Recommender System,"This topic discusses the recommender system used in the push mode of information access, where the system interacts with the user, learns their interest, and recommends relevant information."
Search Engine,"This topic discusses the search engine used in the pull mode of information access, where users enter a query and browse the results to find relevant information."
Information Filtering and Information Retrieval,"This topic discusses the relationship between information filtering, similar to information recommendation or the push mode of information access, and information retrieval, similar to the pull mode of information access."
Text Retrieval,"This topic covers the definition of text retrieval, a task where a system responds to a user's query with relevant documents, and the difference between text retrieval and database retrieval."
Document Selection vs Document Ranking,"This topic explores two strategies for responding to a user's query: document selection, which determines whether a document is relevant or not, and document ranking, which ranks documents based on their likelihood of relevance."
Probability Ranking Principle,"This topic discusses the theoretical justification for document ranking, known as the probability ranking principle, which states that returning a ranked list of documents in descending order of probability that a document is relevant to the query is the optimal strategy."
Challenges in Designing a Search Engine,"This topic highlights the main technical challenge in designing a search engine, which is the design of an effective ranking function."
Text Retrieval Methods,"This topic covers the problem of text retrieval, focusing on the design of a ranking function to rank documents for a query."
Retrieval Models,"This topic discusses the different kinds of retrieval models designed over many decades, categorizing them into models based on similarity, probabilistic models, models based on probabilistic inference, and models using axiomatic thinking."
Common Form of a State of the Art Retrieval Model,"This topic examines the common form of a state of the art retrieval model, discussing the assumption of using bag of words to represent text, the score of a query, and the factors that affect the function such as term frequency, document length, and document frequency."
Comparison of Major Models,"This topic compares the four major models that are generally regarded as state of the art retrieval models, highlighting that BM25 is probably the most popular model."
Vector Space Retrieval Model,"This topic covers the basic idea of the vector space retrieval model, discussing how this model is a specific way of designing a ranking function for document retrieval."
Assumptions in Vector Space Model,"This topic discusses the assumptions made in the vector space model, explaining that the model assumes that if a document is more similar to a query than another document, then the first document will be more relevant."
Representation of Documents and Queries in Vector Space Model,"This topic covers how documents and queries are represented in the vector space model, explaining that each document and query is represented by a term vector, with each term defining one dimension."
Limitations and Questions in Vector Space Model,"This topic discusses the limitations and unanswered questions in the vector space model, pointing out that the model does not define how to select the basic concepts, how to place documents and queries in the space, or how to define the similarity measure."
Vector Space Model,"This topic discusses the vector space model, a particular approach to designing a ranking function, and how to use the general framework of the vector space model to derive a specific ranking function."
Defining Dimensions and Vectors,"This topic covers how to define the dimensions and vectors in the vector space model, explaining that each word in the vocabulary can define a dimension and that a bit vector can represent both the query and a document."
Measuring Similarity,"This topic discusses how to measure the similarity between the query vector and the document vector in the vector space model, explaining that a commonly used similarity measure is the dot product."
Instantiating the Vector Space Model,"This topic covers how to instantiate the vector space model, explaining that the simplest vector space model is based on the bit vector, dot product similarity, and bag of words."
Improving the Vector Space Model,"This topic discusses the need to improve the vector space model, explaining that the simple vector space model doesn't work well because it doesn't account for word frequency or the importance of certain words in the query."
