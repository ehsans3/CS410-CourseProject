b'Analytical Verification for Vibration Testing Technique Used in Determination of Crack in Cantilever Beams Ehsan Sarfaraz and Hamid R. HamidzadehDepartment of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Tennessee State University3500 John A. Merritt Blvd., Nashville, TN 37209-1561, USA(615) 963-5387; fax (615) 963-5496; e-mail: esarfara@my.tnstate.edu, hhamidzadeh@tnstate.edu AbstractA nondestructive experimental technique for determination of structural flaws in cantilever beams is presented.  The proposed method is capable of detecting location of cracks and other possible structural flaws on a beam using its first two natural frequencies measured by an accelerometer on a moveable mass on the beam at several locations along the beam.  To verify the validity of the proposed method, vibration response of a cracked cantilever beam with a stationary roving mass is investigated. The beam is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam with a rectangular cross section. The axial and transverse deformations of the cracked beam are coupled through a stiffness matrix determined using the fracture mechanics principles. The developed model is used to determine analytical solutions for the variation of natural frequencies and mode shapes of a cracked cantilever beam versus the position of the roving mass. The analysis indicates that the variation of the natural frequencies versus position of the roving mass can drastically change when the roving mass is close to the position of a flaw.  Moreover, the effects of the location and depth of the crack, the location and the weight of the roving mass on the natural frequencies, and mode shapes of the beam are investigated. The analytical results show that the coupling between the axial and transverse vibrations for moderate values of crack depth and/or roving mass is weak.  Increasing the crack depth, the mass and the rotary inertia increases the coupling effect. IntroductionBeams are one of the most commonly used structural elements in various engineering applications. They are often subjected to a wide variety of static and dynamic loads. Damages in such structures and applications are commonly due to cracks. Crack(s) in beam could seriously influence the beam\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic characteristics. Some of the impacts of cracks in beam are increase in flexibility, reduction in the natural frequencies, and alteration to the vibration mode shapes. There are several works in literature on crack detection (ranging from the size to the  location of the crack) in the structure using various techniques [1-5].There are also plenty of other research works on how the loading conditions and the crack affect the dynamic response of the structural performance [6-10]. Dimarogonas and Papadopoulos investigated the transverse vibration of cracked shafts and they computed the local flexibility due to the crack based on linear elastic fracture mechanics [11]. Later on they extended their work to the coupled longitudinal and bending vibrations of cracked shafts [12]. Chondros et al. [13] and Chondros and Dimarogonas [14] studied the vibrations of cracked beams with simply supported and cantilever boundary conditions, respectively. They compared their results for the local flexibility method with their experimental results, and observed that the results were in good agreement. Masoud et al. [15] studied the coupling effects between the axial load and the crack depth of a cracked beam with fixed ends. They found that the significance of the coupling effect was directly proportional to the axial load and the depth of crack. It should be noted that vibration of a beam carrying a concentrated mass at an arbitrary location was studied by Low [16]. He determined the non-dimensional frequencies response of the system by solving the equations of motion and by imposing the corresponding boundary and compatibility conditions. His computed results showed an excellent agreement with the available experiment results.  Dado and Abuzeid [9] studied the vibration response of cracked cantilever beam with an end mass including its rotary inertia and considered the coupling effect between axial and transverse deformation. Lin and Chang [7] investigated the dynamic response of cracked cantilever beams under a moving load and presented numerical results for different crack sizes, crack locations, and different load speeds. Mahmoud and Zaid [10] used an iterative modal analysis approach to get the dynamic response of a cracked simply supported beam subjected to a moving mass. Zhong and Oyadiji [6] obtained an analytical solution of natural frequencies of cracked simply supported beams with a stationary roving mass. The effect of the crack was represented by a discontinuity or change in the slope of the beam at the crack location. Fracture mechanics technique was used to obtain the flexibility constant which connects the change of the slope and the moment of the beam. In this work, the vibration responses of a cracked cantilever beam with a stationary mass at numerous locations along the beam are investigated. The beam is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. The concentrated mass is modeled by introducing boundary conditions such that the deformations at the two sides of the mass have to satisfy the compatibility requirements. The crack is modeled by a massless springs with sectional flexibility. The transverse deformation and axial deformation of the cracked beam are coupled in a stiffness matrix which is determined based on fracture mechanics. The analytical solutions are obtained for the natural frequencies and mode shapes. The effects of the location and depth of the crack, and the location and the mass of the roving mass on the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the beam are also investigated. The presented analysis is to verify the viability of a nondestructive experimental vibration technique to determine position of possible flaw within the cantilever beams Formulation of Cantilever Beam with an Open CrackConsider a cracked cantilever beam with a block as shown in Figure 1 where the mass of the block is m, and its rotary inertia about the neutral axis of the cross section of the beam is J. The crack in the beam is assumed to be in the transverse direction with a depth of hc.  As depicted in Figure 1, Lm, Lc, and L represent the distance from the left end of the beam (clamped end) to the location of the concentrated mass, the position of the crack, and the right end of the beam respectively. The cross section of the beam is rectangular with a width of b and a height of h. It is assumed that the material of the beam is linear elastic, and the crack always remains open during vibration so that the complexities associated with the nonlinear characteristics will be neglected [17]. Figure 1: A cracked cantilever beam with auxiliary mass and rotary inertia.In this work, both axial and transverse vibrations will be considered. The equation that governs the axial vibration of the beam can be expressed as [18]:(1)where u(x,t) is the axial displacement of a point in the beam,  is the material density, and E is the Young\xe2\x80\x99s modulus. By using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the equation that governs the transverse vibration of the beam can be expressed as [19]: (2)where v(x,t) is the transverse displacement of the beam, A is the beam\xe2\x80\x99s cross section area, and I is the second moment of area for the cross section with respect to its neutral axis. Considering the free vibration is harmonic, then the axial and transverse displacements can be written as: (3)(4)the spatial domains of the governing equations are given by (5)(6)It should be noted that both U and V are function of the non-dimensional variable of, and  are defined as(7)(8)Note that both  are directly related to the natural frequency of the beam,.The general solutions for differential equations (5) and (6) are well known. For the cantilever beam model shown in Figure1, the beam may be divided into three segments, and the general solutions of U and V for each segment can be written as follows:For the first segment, ,   (9)  (10)For the second segment, ,     (11)     (12)For the third segment, ,   (13)   (14)where  through  are arbitrary constants which can be determined by the boundary conditions and the compatibility conditions at the concentrated mass location and the crack location.The boundary conditions at the fixed end of the cantilever beam (see Figure 1) require that the axial and transverse displacements, as well as the slope of the transverse displacements to be zero.(15)Similarly for the free end of the beam, axial strain, shear force and bending moments are required to be zero.(16)At the location of the concentrated mass and rotary inertia,, the compatibility requirements enforce the continuity of axial and transverse the displacement components and the slope such that(17)The discontinuity in the forces and moment duo to the presence of the concentrated mass gives(18)(19)(20)where  and  are respectively the mass ratio and rotary inertia ratio, and are given by  (21)The presence of a transverse crack in the beam reduces the stiffness. Thus, the crack may be modeled as an extensional spring and/or a rotational spring. The number of springs needed depends on the degrees of freedom considered. As both axial and transverse vibrations of the beam are being considered, we will model the crack as an extensional spring and a rotational spring. At the crack location,, the compatibility requirements can be expressed using the model used in references [9, 20]:(22)(23)The axial force P and the bending moment M at the crack may be expressed as(24)where  are the elements of the stiffness matrix, and are the functions of the crack depth, cross section geometry of the beam, and the material properties. The derivations of these elements are given in Appendix A. On the other hand, P and M can be expressed by the deformation components as(25)Combining equations (22) and (23) gives(26)There are 18 equations, i.e., (15) through (20), (22), (23) and (26), and these equations define a set of 18 homogeneous linear simultaneous algebraic equations with  to  as variables. These equations may be written in matrix form as(27)where  is a vector of variables, [B] is an 18 by 18 matrix whose elements are determined by those 18 equations. Note that some of the elements of [B] contain natural frequency. The natural frequencies of the vibration of the cantilever beam are determined by letting the determinant of [B] be zero, i.e.(28)For a natural frequency obtained from equation (28), the associated mode shape can be obtained by solving equation (27) for . By choosing the value of one of the variables as unit (for example, let A1 = 1), all other A\xe2\x80\x99s can be found from equation (27). Once these constants are determined, substitute them back into equations (9) to (14), the mode shape is then determined.Numerical Results and DiscussionsTo compute the first two natural frequencies of the system, the first two roots of nonlinear algebraic equation (28) have to be determined. Computations of roots of Equation (28) for two different cases were conducted using the fsolve MATLAB function [21]. The first case considered the transverse vibration of a cantilever beam with a concentrated mass attached at the free end. It is assumed that the  beam is made of bright mild steel with Young\xe2\x80\x99s modulus of 210 GPa and mass density of 7850 kg/m3.The length, width, and height of the beam is assumed to be 3000mm, 100 mm, and 25 mm  respectively. Using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, one can determine the analytical solution for the natural frequency as a function of the mass ratio of the concentrated mass to the mass of the beam. Table 1 presents an excellent agreement between numerical results for the first two natural frequencies of a beam with a concentrated mass at the free end [22], and those of the presented model when the concentrated mass is located at the free end.  Furthermore, the computed percentage of errors are presented in Table 1 verify the validity of the presented approach. It should be noted that the analytical solution presented in the table below is also a numerical solution for the reason that the resulting equation for the natural frequency is a nonlinear equation [22]. Due to presented modeling of the crack, the formulation introduced in this paper would not automatically reduce to the governing equation for a whole beam, as the crack depth approach zero.The second case study consider a cantilever beam with a transverse crack where the beam is 300 mm long and it has a square cross section with side length of 20 mm. In this case, the crack is located at the position of 140 mm away from the fixed end, and has a depth of 10 mm. Furthermore, the Young\xe2\x80\x99s modulus for the beam is 206 GPa, and its mass density is 7800 kg/m3. The first three natural frequencies were computed, and the results were compared with the numerical results obtained by Lin and Chang [7], and the experimental results obtained by Rizos and Aspragathos [23]. The comparison of the natural frequencies and the computed percentage of errors are presented in Table 2. This table demonstrates that the results of this study are in a good agreement with the experimental results for the examined cracked cantilever beam.

The beam\xe2\x80\x99s geometrical and material properties will be the same as the case study examined above. The effects of the crack will be examined first, followed by the effect of mass, and the combined effect of crack and concentrated mass.Effect of the Crack on the Natural FrequenciesThe effects of the crack depth (non-dimensional parameter hc/h) and its location (non-dimensional parameter Lc/L) on the first two natural frequencies  and  are examined. Figure 2 shows the three-dimensional plots of normalized natural frequencies versus hc/h and Lc/L for non-dimensional mass ratio mr=0, mr=0.05 and 0.5 at a fixed point Lm/L = 0.45. The two frequencies have been normalized by dividing them by their counterpart of the intact beam, i.e.,  and.As illustrated, the general trends for changes in the first two natural frequencies for different possible position of a crack and wide range of crack depth ratios for three different mass ratios in three cases have been shown. In fact the main scope of the presented graphs is to draw conclusion for the general trend of these frequencies.  From the presented results, it was observed that the presence of the concentrated mass does not alter the patterns of either natural frequency. In fact, the natural frequencies decrease as the ratio mr increases. For the values of mr from zero up to 0.5, when the crack depth is hc/h < 0.50, the crack does not have a significant effect on the natural frequencies. It is estimated that for the range of values of hc/h from 0 to 0.50, the maximum difference for both natural frequencies is no more than 3.5%. It is shown, as the crack depth increases, both natural frequencies decrease; however, that effect is strongly dependent on the crack location. The effect of the crack location on the two natural frequencies is different. For the first natural frequency, the closer the crack to the fixed end of the beam, the bigger it affects the frequency. While for the second natural frequency, the most critical effect occurs when the crack is around the mid-span of the beam. The next severe effect occurs when the crack is near the fixed end of the beam. For both frequencies, the crack effect is diminishing as the crack is closing to the free end of the cantilever beam.Effects of the Concentrated Mass on the Natural FrequenciesThe effect of the concentrated mass and its location on the natural frequencies of the cracked beam were examined. Figures 3 shows the three-dimensional plots of the normalized first two natural frequencies versus mr and Lm/L for hc/h = 0, 0.2, and 0.8, respectively. The crack is assumed to be located at a fixed point of Lc/L = 0.35. Figure 3 illustrates the results of an intact cantilever beam carrying a mass. When mr=0,   and. When,  decreases as the concentrated mass increases. also decreases as the mass is placed away from the fixed end of the beam. is affected by the concentrated mass in a different way; it reduces significantly the value of  as it is moving away from the fixed end of the beam to the center of the beam. The effect is diminishing as it continues moving away from the center, and becomes significant again as it closing to the free end of the beam. Similar patterns were reported by Low [16]. In order to examine the effect of the crack length on the frequencies, the first two natural frequencies against Lm/L are computed, and the results are given in Table 3. The normalized frequencies  and  versus Lm/L are plotted in Figure 4, respectively. In both cases, mr = 0.8, and the crack is assumed to be located at Lc/L = 0.35. These results show that the presence of a crack in the beam does not alter the frequency patterns, only amplifies them.hc/hhc/hCase 1: mr=0hc/hhc/hCase 2: mr=0.05 hc/hhc/hCase 3: mr=0.5Figure 2: Variation of first two normalized natural frequencies versus Lc/L and hc/h for different mass ratios of mr = 0.0, 0.05, and 0.5Case 1: hc/h = 0Case 2: hc/h = 0.2Case 3: hc/h = 0.8Figure 3: Variation of first two normalized natural frequencies versus concentrated mass and its location for three different values of hc/h = 0.0, 0.2, and 0.8        Table 3: Natural frequencies versus Lm/L for a cantilever beam (mr = 0.8 and Lc/L = 0.35)Lm/L(rad/s)(rad/s)hc/h = 0hc /h = 0.2hc /h = 0.8hc /h = 0hc /h = 0.2hc /h = 0.80.00114.5814.5613.3591.3991.2885.860.0514.5814.5613.3591.2991.1885.760.1014.5814.5513.3590.0789.9684.510.1514.5514.5313.3385.8785.7680.210.2014.4814.4613.2978.6578.5272.780.2514.3614.3413.2171.0870.9464.720.3014.1514.1413.0765.1965.0357.940.3513.8513.8312.8761.4461.2452.830.4013.4513.4312.5059.7059.5753.480.4512.9612.9412.0359.8059.7155.030.5012.4112.3911.5061.6461.5657.720.5511.8211.8010.9265.1865.1161.720.6011.2011.1910.3370.4670.3967.090.6510.6010.589.7477.2777.2073.630.7010.009.999.1784.6884.5980.330.759.449.428.6390.2190.1084.960.808.908.888.1291.1191.0085.600.858.398.387.6487.5387.4382.680.907.917.907.1981.5481.4677.780.9997.067.056.4068.2668.2266.46 Lm / LLm / LFigure 4: Normalized natural frequencies vs. Lm/L for mr = 0.8 and Lc/L = 0.35 for three different values oh hc/hAnalysis of Mode ShapesThe numerical results show that for intact beams the axial displacement U(x) is insignificant. However, for cracked beams, U(x) is in general much smaller than V(x). It should be noted that U(x) varies as a sine function with very small (almost flat) value, along the longitudinal direction of the beam. Its value has a relatively big change across the crack, and then becomes flat again. The transverse displacement V(x) is the dominant deformation, and the mode shapes of V(x) are close to their counterpart of the intact cantilever beam without a concentrated mass. The coupling between U(x) and V(x) is dependent on the crack depth, and is very weak except for extremely deep crack depth. Figures 5-7 show the first two mode shapes for the three typical cases. For all the three cases, the mass ratio mr is fixed at 0.5 and the crack depth ratio hc/h is fixed at 0.5. The difference among these cases is the relative position of the crack, and the concentrated mass. Note that the U and V values in these figures do not reflect the real deformation of these problems.(b)(a)Figure 5: The first two mode shapes of cracked beam for Lm/L = 0.6 and Lc/L = 0.35, where and, (a) axial displacements and (b) transverse displacements (b)(a) Figure 6: The first two mode shapes of cracked beam for Lm/L = 0.6 and Lc/L = 0.70, where and, (a) axial displacements and (b) transverse displacements(a)(b)                                                     Figure 7: The first two mode shapes of cracked beam for Lm/L = 0.8 and Lc/L = 0.70, where and, (a) axial displacements and (b) transverse displacementsDetection of Crack Location Case 1First DerivativeFor simply supported beams, Zhong and Oyadiji proposed a frequency-domain approach to detect the damage location [24]. For an aluminum beam, they used finite element method combined with the spectral center correction method to determine variation of the fundamental natural frequency versus position of the mass. They used derivatives of fundamental frequency with respect to the location of the mass to determine the location of a crack.

Figure 8 for case 1 presents the variation of dimensionless fundamental natural frequency of cracked beam along with the first five derivatives of it with respect to the ratio of Lm / L, mr = 0.8 and Lc/L = 0.35. Obviously, the second derivative curve clearly shows the location of the crack as there exhibits a sharp change of the curve. For contrast, Figure 8 for case 2 shows the result for the same problem except without a crack (i.e. Lc/L = 0). Without a crack, the natural frequency and its derivative curves are all smooth. As demonstrated, position of the crack is indicated by a sharp discontinuity in the second through fifth derivatives curves shown below. CONCLUDING REMARKSVibration behavior of cracked cantilever beams under a roving stationary concentrated mass and rotary inertia is investigated.  Both the axial and transverse deformations are considered. The continuous beam was divided into three segments by the concentrated mass and the crack. Vibration of each segment is analyzed by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The boundary conditions and the compatibility requirements at the joints of the segments are reinforced. The crack is modeled as elastic springs (one extensional and another rotational), and the stiffness matrix was obtained based on fracture mechanics. The analytical results show that axial vibration is much smaller compare to the transverse vibration. For the first two modes, the coupling effect between the axial and transverse vibrations is weak. It was observed that both the concentrated mass and the crack reduce the natural frequencies, but the way they affect the frequency is different. Frequencies decrease as the concentrated mass and/or crack depth increase.  For the values of mass ratio mr and the crack depth ratio a/h up to 0.5, the reduction of the first two natural frequencies is no more than 3.5%. The effect of the crack location on the two natural frequencies is different. As was expected for the first frequency, as the crack closing to the fixed end of the beam, reduction of the frequency increases. For the second natural frequency, when the crack is around the mid-span of the beam, or the fixed end of the beam, the reduction of the frequency increases. For both frequencies, the crack effect is diminishing as the crack is closing to the free end of the cantilever beam. The location of the concentrated mass has significantly effect on the frequencies. For the first natural frequency, as the mass moves away from the fixed end of the beam to the free end of the beam, the reduction of the frequency increases. For the second natural frequency, the concentrated mass wound reduces significantly the frequency when it is around the center of the beam, or close to the free end of the beam. Furthermore, the second derivative of the first natural frequency curve is an effective indicator to show the location of the crack in the cantilever beam. The presented non-destructive experimental approach is capable of identifying the positions of separate flaws along the beam; however, the accuracy of the procedure can be enhanced by increasing the number of measuring points for the first two natural frequencies of the stationary roving mass along the beam. Based on the methodology presented here, similar experimental procedure can be adopted to determine location of flaws for a given specific structure by comparing the experimental results with similar data for a similar complex structure without flaws.

For an Euler-Bernoulli beam with a transverse crack under axial force P and moment M, the mode I stress intensity factor can be expressed by using the superposition principle as                         (A1)where  is the non-dimensional crack depth, b and h are the width and height of the cross section of the beam, and F1 and F2 are functions of  and are given by(A2)(A3)Assuming the plane strain condition, the energy release rate is related to the stress intensity factor by          (A4)where E is the Young\xe2\x80\x99s modulus, and  is the Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s ratio. The local flexibility matrix elements are given by(A5)(A6)(A7)where  is the maximum crack depth. The integrals in equations (A5) through (A7) are evaluated numerically using 16-point Gauss quadrature formula. The results are then fitted to polynomial expressions with  as variable. The flexibility matrix elements are found as:(A8)(A9) (A10)Therefore, the stiffness matrix is given by      (A11)'
