EM Algorithm,The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm used to find the maximum likelihood estimate of models. It involves computing a lower bound (E-step) and maximizing this lower bound (M-step). The starting point can significantly influence the outcome.
E-Step and M-Step,The E-step involves computing the lower bound by predicting the values of hidden variables. The M-step exploits the augmented data to improve the estimate of parameters.
Data Augmentation,"Data augmentation is done probabilistically, assigning a probability distribution over the possible values of hidden variables. This results in a probabilistic split of event counts."
Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA),"PLSA is a topic model used to mine multiple topics from text documents. It can be used to decode the topics behind the text, segment the topics, and determine which words are from which distribution."
