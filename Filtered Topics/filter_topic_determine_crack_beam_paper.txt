 description Analytical Verification Vibration Testing Technique Used Determination Crack Cantilever Beams topic discusses nondestructive experimental technique identifying structural flaws cantilever beams. technique uses first two natural frequencies measured accelerometer moveable mass beam several locations detect cracks structural flaws. Effects Crack Concentrated Mass Natural Frequencies topic explores presence crack concentrated mass cantilever beam affects natural frequencies. found crack concentrated mass reduce natural frequencies affect frequencies different ways. Analysis Mode Shapes topic examines mode shapes cracked beams finding axial displacement generally much smaller transverse displacement. coupling axial transverse vibrations weak except extremely deep crack depth. Detection Crack Location topic discusses method detecting location crack cantilever beam using second derivative fundamental natural frequency respect location mass. position crack indicated sharp discontinuity derivative curves. Concluding Remarks Vibration Behavior Cracked Cantilever Beams topic summarizes findings study noting concentrated mass crack reduce natural frequencies beam. study also finds second derivative first natural frequency curve effective indicator location crack cantilever beam.
