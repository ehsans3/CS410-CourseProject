Influence of Embedded Material on Natural Frequencies of Double Segment Rotating Disk topic covers the effects of incorporating different materials at one edge of a rotating disk on its natural frequencies and critical speeds.  discussion is based on the linear in-plane free vibration of a compound disk with material discontinuity.
In-Plane Free Vibration of Rotating Disks  topic delves into the in-plane free vibration of rotating disks especially those with material discontinuity.  examines the impact of rotational speed and radius ratio on the natural frequency and elastic stability of fixed-free rotating disks. 
Development of the Governing Equation  topic involves the derivation of the governing equations of motion for a rotating compound disk.  covers the plane stress condition the equations of motion for a point on the disk in polar coordinates and the associated normal and shear stresses. 
Modal Stresses and Displacements  topic discusses the solution to the coupled differential equations presented in the governing equations of motion.  introduces the modal elastic rotation and dilatation and the radial and tangential displacement in terms of time. 
Natural Frequency Equations topic explains the process of obtaining the modal information and natural frequencies of the rotating disk.  discusses the boundary conditions and the compatibility of the modal displacements and stresses.
Discussion and Results  topic presents the results of the study including the natural frequencies critical speeds and distribution of stresses and displacements for two different sizes of added disk segments with material discontinuity.  also discusses the effect of the embedded material properties on the variations of non-dimensional natural frequency versus rotating speeds. 
Conclusions  topic summarizes the study's findings emphasizing the impact of rotational speed radius ratio mode of vibration and material properties on the natural frequencies of a rotating disk.  also discusses the potential applications of the study in the design of rotating disks.
