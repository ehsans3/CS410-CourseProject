Analytical Verification for Vibration Testing Technique Used in Determination of Crack in Cantilever Beams topic discusses a nondestructive experimental technique for identifying structural flaws in cantilever beams.  technique uses the first two natural frequencies measured by an accelerometer on a moveable mass on the beam at several locations to detect cracks and other structural flaws.
Effects of Crack and Concentrated Mass on Natural Frequencies  topic explores how the presence of a crack and a concentrated mass on a cantilever beam affects its natural frequencies.  is found that both the crack and the concentrated mass reduce the natural frequencies but they affect the frequencies in different ways. 
Analysis of Mode Shapes  topic examines the mode shapes of cracked beams finding that the axial displacement is generally much smaller than the transverse displacement.  coupling between the axial and transverse vibrations is weak except for extremely deep crack depth. 
Detection of Crack Location topic discusses a method for detecting the location of a crack in a cantilever beam using the second derivative of the fundamental natural frequency with respect to the location of the mass.  position of the crack is indicated by a sharp discontinuity in the derivative curves.
Concluding Remarks on Vibration Behavior of Cracked Cantilever Beams  topic summarizes the findings of the study noting that both the concentrated mass and the crack reduce the natural frequencies of the beam.  study also finds that the second derivative of the first natural frequency curve is an effective indicator of the location of the crack in the cantilever beam.
